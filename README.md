# Explanation of the Project

In the model folder there are three classes:
- Account: this class will correspond with a table in the DB that hold the information of each account in the system.
- Transaction: this class will correspond with a table in the DB where all the transactions are tracked.
- DataClass: for this example we create two account with positive balance.
- JTableResult: that will hold all the elements for populate the table of transactions

I created a Utilities folder that will help to manage the completion of the different tasks in the system.

The Transaction folder will hold the Restful calls methods in the system.
